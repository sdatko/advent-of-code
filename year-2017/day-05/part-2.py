#
# Now, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was three
# or more, instead decrease it by 1. Otherwise, increase it by 1 as before.
#
# Using this rule with the above example, the process now takes 10 steps,
# and the offset values after finding the exit are left as 2 3 2 3 -1.
#
# How many steps does it now take to reach the exit?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The only difference here is that conditionally we increment or decrement
# the current field before jumping to a new index. This still finished in
# a finite time, though much more steps are required. Additionally, it turned
# out that using try-except construction is faster than checking for the index
# being within the valid boundary every time (known as EAFP vs LBYL approiach).
