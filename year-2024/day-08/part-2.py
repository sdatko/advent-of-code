# --- Day 8: Resonant Collinearity / Part Two ---
#
# Watching over your shoulder as you work, one of The Historians asks
# if you took the effects of resonant harmonics into your calculations.
#
# Whoops!
#
# After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at any
# grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same
# frequency, regardless of distance. This means that some of the new antinodes
# will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only
# one of its frequency).
#
# So, these three T-frequency antennas now create many antinodes:
#
#   T....#....
#   ...T......
#   .T....#...
#   .........#
#   ..#.......
#   ..........
#   ...#......
#   ..........
#   ....#.....
#   ..........
#
# In fact, the three T-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with
# two antennas, so they are all also antinodes! This brings the total number
# of antinodes in the above example to 9.
#
# The original example now has 34 antinodes, including the antinodes
# that appear on every antenna:
#
#   ##....#....#
#   .#.#....0...
#   ..#.#0....#.
#   ..##...0....
#   ....0....#..
#   .#...#A....#
#   ...#..#.....
#   #....#.#....
#   ..#.....A...
#   ....#....A..
#   .#........#.
#   ...#......##
#
# Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model.
# How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The difference in this part is that we do not consider just 2 antinodes for
# each pair, but all possible resonant resonant harmonic locations before and
# after the pair â€“ which means that from antennas locations we consider all
# positions that can be reached with calculated positions differences (dx, dy),
# including also the original antennas locations (as B=A+dx and A=B-dx are
# antoniodes as well!).
#
#   ------#-------#-------A-------B-------#-------#-------#-------#-------#->
#           A-2dx   A-dx    (B-A)    B+dx                               x axis
