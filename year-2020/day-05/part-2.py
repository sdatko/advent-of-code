# --- Day 5: Binary Boarding / Part Two ---
#
# Ding! The "fasten seat belt" signs have turned on. Time to find your seat.
#
# It's a completely full flight, so your seat should be the only missing
# boarding pass in your list. However, there's a catch: some of the seats
# at the very front and back of the plane don't exist on this aircraft,
# so they'll be missing from your list as well.
#
# Your seat wasn't at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs
# +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list.
#
# What is the ID of your seat?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# First we produce a set of all possibly available seats IDs â€“ every seat
# is coded on 10 digits, so there are (2^N - 1) possibilities in total.
# Then we remove every seat we know is occupied from this list.
# Finally we check if in remaining available seats are such ones that
# have previous and next seat occupied.
