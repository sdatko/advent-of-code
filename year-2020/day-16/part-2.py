# --- Day 16: Ticket Translation / Part Two ---
#
# Now that you've identified which tickets contain invalid values,
# discard those tickets entirely. Use the remaining valid tickets
# to determine which field is which.
#
# Using the valid ranges for each field, determine what order the fields
# appear on the tickets. The order is consistent between all tickets:
# if seat is the third field, it is the third field on every ticket,
# including your ticket.
#
# For example, suppose you have the following notes:
#
#   class: 0-1 or 4-19
#   row: 0-5 or 8-19
#   seat: 0-13 or 16-19
#
#   your ticket:
#   11,12,13
#
#   nearby tickets:
#   3,9,18
#   15,1,5
#   5,14,9
#
# Based on the nearby tickets in the above example, the first position
# must be row, the second position must be class, and the third position
# must be seat; you can conclude that in your ticket, class is 12,
# row is 11, and seat is 13.
#
# Once you work out which field is which, look for the six fields
# on your ticket that start with the word departure. What do you get
# if you multiply those six values together?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# First step is to create a collection of valid tickets, which contains all
# tickets that did not have bad values, plus our own ticket. Then from each
# ticket in that collection of valid ones, we take the same field, obtaining
# list of values on the position number #i. Next we iterate over the list
# of constraints and we check whether all these values fit in given ranges.
# This way be build a collection of possible positions of fields on ticket.
# Finally the tricky part is to notice that most of the fields satisfy more
# than one constraint â€“ so by elimination, we need to pick first the field
# which fits exactly one class' constraints, then remove it as a candidate
# from all other possible positions. By doing so for every field, eventually
# we receive set of unique positions. Then we just need to find the indexes
# of fields with names starting from `departure` and multiply values under
# given indexes on our ticket.
