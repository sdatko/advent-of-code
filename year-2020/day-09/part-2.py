# --- Day 9: Encoding Error / Part Two ---
#
# The final step in breaking the XMAS encryption relies on the invalid
# number you just found: you must find a contiguous set of at least
# two numbers in your list which sum to the invalid number from step 1.
#
# Again consider the above example:
#
#   35
#   20
#   15
#   25
#   47
#   40
#   62
#   55
#   65
#   95
#   102
#   117
#   150
#   182
#   127
#   219
#   299
#   277
#   309
#   576
#
# In this list, adding up all of the numbers from 15 through 40 produces
# the invalid number from step 1, 127. (Of course, the contiguous set
# of numbers in your actual list might be much longer.)
#
# To find the encryption weakness, add together the smallest and largest
# number in this contiguous range; in this example, these are 15 and 47,
# producing 62.
#
# What is the encryption weakness in your XMAS-encrypted list of numbers?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# Here we just implement another sliding window on the input list of numbers,
# but with various width â€“ from minimum size 2 to the end of array. Then we
# produce a subset of that window and calculate a sum of its elements.
# If it is equal to our wrong number, we have what we need.
# The additional break, if sum for current start and window size exceeds
# already our target number, reduces the processing time significantly.
#
