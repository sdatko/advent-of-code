# --- Day 19: Aplenty / Part Two ---
#
# Even with your help, the sorting process still isn't fast enough.
#
# One of the Elves comes up with a new plan: rather than sort parts
# individually through all of these workflows, maybe you can figure out
# in advance which combinations of ratings will be accepted or rejected.
#
# Each of the four ratings (x, m, a, s) can have an integer value
# ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4000. Of all possible
# distinct combinations of ratings, your job is to figure out which ones
# will be accepted.
#
# In the above example, there are 167409079868000 distinct combinations
# of ratings that will be accepted.
#
# Consider only your list of workflows; the list of part ratings that
# the Elves wanted you to sort is no longer relevant. How many distinct
# combinations of ratings will be accepted by the Elves' workflows?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The difference here is that here we need to find a solution not for given
# input ranges from file, but for all possible combinations of values of x,
# m, a and s â€“ which is 256_000_000_000_000 possibilities. This numbers is
# to large for iterative verification of each combination, hence what we need
# to do is to work on ranges of values for all parameters. Starting on initial
# ('in', {'x': (1, 4000), 'y': (1, 4000), 'a': (1, 4000), 's': (1, 4000)}),
# for a given example workflow `in{s<1351:px,qqz}` we would produce two groups:
# ('px', {'x': (1, 4000), 'y': (1, 4000), 'a': (1, 4000), 's': (1, 1350)}),
# ('qqz', {'x': (1, 4000), 'y': (1, 4000), 'a': (1, 4000), 's': (1351, 4000)}).
# We continue such processing and divisions until we obtain there a group with
# either accepted or rejected workflow name. Finally, we can return the number
# of combinations by summarizing counts of values within all accepted ranges.
#
# The change of ranges can be neatly presented with so called Sankey diagrams.
#
