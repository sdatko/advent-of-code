# --- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion / Part Two ---
#
# The galaxies are much older (and thus much farther apart)
# than the researcher initially estimated.
#
# Now, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row
# or column one million times larger. That is, each empty row should
# be replaced with 1000000 empty rows, and each empty column should be
# replaced with 1000000 empty columns.
#
# (In the example above, if each empty row or column were merely 10 times
# larger, the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies
# would be 1030. If each empty row or column were merely 100 times larger,
# the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be 8410.
# However, your universe will need to expand far beyond these values.)
#
# Starting with the same initial image, expand the universe according to
# these new rules, then find the length of the shortest path between every
# pair of galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The difference here is that instead of inserting a single additional row
# or colum after each empty one, we add multiple ones. The general idea is
# that we replace single row/column with N rows/columns â€“ to make the space
# N times bigger; this corresponds to inserting additional (N-1) rows/columns.
# The rest of the code remains the same as in previous part.
