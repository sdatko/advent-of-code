# --- Day 21: Step Counter ---
#
# You manage to catch the airship right as it's dropping someone else off
# on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops
# you off near the gardener and his massive farm.
#
# "You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until
# we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow
# again in no time."
#
# While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good
# you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his
# steps in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can
# reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.
#
# He gives you an up-to-date map (your puzzle input) of his starting position
# (S), garden plots (.), and rocks (#). For example:
#
#   ...........
#   .....###.#.
#   .###.##..#.
#   ..#.#...#..
#   ....#.#....
#   .##..S####.
#   .##..#...#.
#   .......##..
#   .##.#.####.
#   .##..##.##.
#   ...........
#
# The Elf starts at the starting position (S) which also counts as a garden
# plot. Then, he can take one step north, south, east, or west, but only
# onto tiles that are garden plots. This would allow him to reach any
# of the tiles marked O:
#
#   ...........
#   .....###.#.
#   .###.##..#.
#   ..#.#...#..
#   ....#O#....
#   .##.OS####.
#   .##..#...#.
#   .......##..
#   .##.#.####.
#   .##..##.##.
#   ...........
#
# Then, he takes a second step. Since at this point he could be at either
# tile marked O, his second step would allow him to reach any garden plot
# that is one step north, south, east, or west of any tile that he could
# have reached after the first step:
#
#   ...........
#   .....###.#.
#   .###.##..#.
#   ..#.#O..#..
#   ....#.#....
#   .##O.O####.
#   .##.O#...#.
#   .......##..
#   .##.#.####.
#   .##..##.##.
#   ...........
#
# After two steps, he could be at any of the tiles marked O above,
# including the starting position (either by going north-then-south
# or by going west-then-east).
#
# A single third step leads to even more possibilities:
#
#   ...........
#   .....###.#.
#   .###.##..#.
#   ..#.#.O.#..
#   ...O#O#....
#   .##.OS####.
#   .##O.#...#.
#   ....O..##..
#   .##.#.####.
#   .##..##.##.
#   ...........
#
# He will continue like this until his steps for the day have been exhausted.
# After a total of 6 steps, he could reach any of the garden plots marked O:
#
#   ...........
#   .....###.#.
#   .###.##.O#.
#   .O#O#O.O#..
#   O.O.#.#.O..
#   .##O.O####.
#   .##.O#O..#.
#   .O.O.O.##..
#   .##.#.####.
#   .##O.##.##.
#   ...........
#
# In this example, if the Elf's goal was to get exactly 6 more steps today,
# he could use them to reach any of 16 garden plots.
#
# However, the Elf actually needs to get 64 steps today, and the map
# he's handed you is much larger than the example map.
#
# Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots
# could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# We start by reading the input file into a 2D grid â€“ by splitting the content
# over newlines and then producing a collection of characters from a line.
# Then from the grid we create a set of positions that corresponds to presence
# of the rocks. Then we create a set of visited positions by looking for start
# indicator in the grid. Next, in a loop, for a given number of steps, we get
# the next positions for each current position and save these next positions
# in a new set of positions; after getting through all current positions,
# we replace the current positions set with the newly produced set. Finally,
# after conducting the simulation for a given number of steps, we simply return
# the number of reached positions as an answer.
