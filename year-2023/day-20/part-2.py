# --- Day 20: Pulse Propagation / Part Two ---
#
# The final machine responsible for moving the sand down to Island Island
# has a module attached named rx. The machine turns on when a single
# low pulse is sent to rx.
#
# Reset all modules to their default states. Waiting for all pulses to be
# fully handled after each button press, what is the fewest number of button
# presses required to deliver a single low pulse to the module named rx?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The difference here is that we need to a perform button pressing until there
# is a low state signal sent to the desired module rx. The catch is â€“ it takes
# very, very long until that happens. After examining the input file we can
# notice that the final state is triggered by a single conjunction, which is
# triggered earlier by a couple of other conjunctions. Since conjunctions
# behave like the NAND gate, they require all inputs to be in high state
# before they will produce the wanted outcome, instead we can keep tracking
# how many presses it will take to put those other conjunctions in right state.
# Then, as the signals going through modules are periodic (as in part 1)
# we can find the necessary number of presses for the rx module by calculating
# the lowest common multiplication of presses needed by rx module sources.
