# --- Day 10: Syntax Scoring / Part Two ---
#
# Now, discard the corrupted lines. The remaining lines are incomplete.
#
# Incomplete lines don't have any incorrect characters - instead, they're
# missing some closing characters at the end of the line. To repair the
# navigation subsystem, you just need to figure out the sequence of closing
# characters that complete all open chunks in the line.
#
# You can only use closing characters (), ], }, or >), and you must add them
# in the correct order so that only legal pairs are formed and all chunks end
# up closed.
#
# In the example above, there are five incomplete lines:
# - [({(<(())[]>[[{[]{<()<>> - Complete by adding }}]])})].
# - [(()[<>])]({[<{<<[]>>( - Complete by adding )}>]}).
# - (((({<>}<{<{<>}{[]{[]{} - Complete by adding }}>}>)))).
# - {<[[]]>}<{[{[{[]{()[[[] - Complete by adding ]]}}]}]}>.
# - <{([{{}}[<[[[<>{}]]]>[]] - Complete by adding ])}>.
#
# Did you know that autocomplete tools also have contests? It's true!
# The score is determined by considering the completion string
# character-by-character. Start with a total score of 0. Then, for each
# character, multiply the total score by 5 and then increase the total score
# by the point value given for the character in the following table:
# - ): 1 point.
# - ]: 2 points.
# - }: 3 points.
# - >: 4 points.
#
# So, the last completion string above - ])}> - would be scored as follows:
# - Start with a total score of 0.
# - Multiply the total score by 5 to get 0, then add the value of ] (2)
#   to get a new total score of 2.
# - Multiply the total score by 5 to get 10, then add the value of ) (1)
#   to get a new total score of 11.
# - Multiply the total score by 5 to get 55, then add the value of } (3)
#   to get a new total score of 58.
# - Multiply the total score by 5 to get 290, then add the value of > (4)
#   to get a new total score of 294.
#
# The five lines' completion strings have total scores as follows:
# - }}]])})] - 288957 total points.
# - )}>]}) - 5566 total points.
# - }}>}>)))) - 1480781 total points.
# - ]]}}]}]}> - 995444 total points.
# - ])}> - 294 total points.
#
# Autocomplete tools are an odd bunch: the winner is found by sorting all
# of the scores and then taking the middle score. (There will always be an odd
# number of scores to consider.) In this example, the middle score is 288957
# because there are the same number of scores smaller and larger than it.
#
# Find the completion string for each incomplete line, score the completion
# strings, and sort the scores. What is the middle score?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# This code is very similar to the one used in part 1 â€“ the only real
# difference is how and when we calculate the points. We are interested
# only in lines that do not have unexpected characters (they only miss
# some elements). This means if we never reached the break in our loop,
# we just need to compute a score for the list of missing (still expected)
# characters and add that sum to list of scores.
# As final answer, we just sort the list of scores and take the middle element.
