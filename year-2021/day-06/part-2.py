# Task:
# Suppose the lanternfish live forever and have unlimited food and space.
# Would they take over the entire ocean?
# How many lanternfish would there be after 256 days?
#
# Solution:
# The code that worked was exactly the same as it was for Part 1.
# We only changed how long the simulation takes place.
# However then I noticed that this can be achieved in more efficient way
# â€“ the shifting of all values is not necessary in each loop iteration,
# all we need is to basically increment single position in the array,
# with the position being changed in every iteration. This way instead
# of shifting the values (copying and saving N times) we shift the index
# of position being incremented (one copy and addition needed per iteration).
