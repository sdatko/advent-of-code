# Task:
# Next, you need to find the largest basins so you know what areas are most
# important to avoid.
# A basin is all locations that eventually flow downward to a single low point.
# Therefore, every low point has a basin, although some basins are very small.
# Locations of height 9 do not count as being in any basin, and all other
# locations will always be part of exactly one basin.
# The size of a basin is the number of locations within the basin, including
# the low point. The example above has four basins.
# Find the three largest basins and multiply their sizes together.
# What do you get if you multiply together the sizes of the three
# largest basins?
#
# Solution:
# This part extends the previous solution, just instead of saving the height
# values we are interested in position (row and column) of the lowest points.
# Then for convenience I calculate the derivatives of matrix values along axes
# x and y (i.e. the differences between i-th and i+1-th elements).
# Worth to notice here is that zip(*heightmap) is a transposition of matrix
# in our current implementation (list of lists).
# Then we go through each lowest point we found â€“ treating each one as the
# starting point for browsing the matrix. In each iteration, we build a list
# of adjacent positions to consider in browsing, taking only the positions
# with height values greater than the one in currently analyzed (considered)
# point. We omit positions that were already visited and the ones that have
# maximum value of height possible (9). Finally, when there are no more points
# to consider, we count and save the number of visited positions.
# For answer we find 3 highest saved numbers and multiply them.
