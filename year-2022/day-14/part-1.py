# --- Day 14: Regolith Reservoir ---
#
# The distress signal leads you to a giant waterfall! Actually, hang on
# - the signal seems like it's coming from the waterfall itself, and that
# doesn't make any sense. However, you do notice a little path that leads
# behind the waterfall.
#
# Correction: the distress signal leads you behind a giant waterfall!
# There seems to be a large cave system here, and the signal definitely
# leads further inside.
#
# As you begin to make your way deeper underground, you feel the ground rumble
# for a moment. Sand begins pouring into the cave! If you don't quickly figure
# out where the sand is going, you could quickly become trapped!
#
# Fortunately, your familiarity with analyzing the path of falling material
# will come in handy here. You scan a two-dimensional vertical slice
# of the cave above you (your puzzle input) and discover that it is
# mostly air with structures made of rock.
#
# Your scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the x,y
# coordinates that form the shape of the path, where x represents distance
# to the right and y represents distance down. Each path appears as a single
# line of text in your scan. After the first point of each path, each point
# indicates the end of a straight horizontal or vertical line to be drawn
# from the previous point. For example:
#
#   498,4 -> 498,6 -> 496,6
#   503,4 -> 502,4 -> 502,9 -> 494,9
#
# This scan means that there are two paths of rock; the first path consists
# of two straight lines, and the second path consists of three straight lines.
# (Specifically, the first path consists of a line of rock from 498,4 through
# 498,6 and another line of rock from 498,6 through 496,6.)
#
# The sand is pouring into the cave from point 500,0.
#
# Drawing rock as #, air as ., and the source of the sand as +, this becomes:
#
#     4     5  5
#     9     0  0
#     4     0  3
#   0 ......+...
#   1 ..........
#   2 ..........
#   3 ..........
#   4 ....#...##
#   5 ....#...#.
#   6 ..###...#.
#   7 ........#.
#   8 ........#.
#   9 #########.
#
# Sand is produced one unit at a time, and the next unit of sand is not
# produced until the previous unit of sand comes to rest. A unit of sand
# is large enough to fill one tile of air in your scan.
#
# A unit of sand always falls down one step if possible. If the tile
# immediately below is blocked (by rock or sand), the unit of sand attempts
# to instead move diagonally one step down and to the left. If that tile
# is blocked, the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally one step
# down and to the right. Sand keeps moving as long as it is able to do so,
# at each step trying to move down, then down-left, then down-right.
# If all three possible destinations are blocked, the unit of sand comes
# to rest and no longer moves, at which point the next unit of sand is created
# back at the source.
#
# So, drawing sand that has come to rest as o, the first unit of sand simply
# falls straight down and then stops:
#
#   ......+...
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ....#...##
#   ....#...#.
#   ..###...#.
#   ........#.
#   ......o.#.
#   #########.
#
# The second unit of sand then falls straight down, lands on the first one,
# and then comes to rest to its left:
#
#   ......+...
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ....#...##
#   ....#...#.
#   ..###...#.
#   ........#.
#   .....oo.#.
#   #########.
#
# After a total of five units of sand have come to rest,
# they form this pattern:
#
#   ......+...
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ..........
#   ....#...##
#   ....#...#.
#   ..###...#.
#   ......o.#.
#   ....oooo#.
#   #########.
#
# After a total of 22 units of sand:
#
#   ......+...
#   ..........
#   ......o...
#   .....ooo..
#   ....#ooo##
#   ....#ooo#.
#   ..###ooo#.
#   ....oooo#.
#   ...ooooo#.
#   #########.
#
# Finally, only two more units of sand can possibly come to rest:
#
#   ......+...
#   ..........
#   ......o...
#   .....ooo..
#   ....#ooo##
#   ...o#ooo#.
#   ..###ooo#.
#   ....oooo#.
#   .o.ooooo#.
#   #########.
#
# Once all 24 units of sand shown above have come to rest, all further sand
# flows out the bottom, falling into the endless void. Just for fun, the path
# any new sand takes before falling forever is shown here with ~:
#
#   .......+...
#   .......~...
#   ......~o...
#   .....~ooo..
#   ....~#ooo##
#   ...~o#ooo#.
#   ..~###ooo#.
#   ..~..oooo#.
#   .~o.ooooo#.
#   ~#########.
#   ~..........

#
# Using your scan, simulate the falling sand. How many units of sand come
# to rest before sand starts flowing into the abyss below?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# We start by reading the input file as a list of sequences, each sequence
# being a list of coordinates (x,y) of the horizontal/vertical lines ends
# (so first we split input by newline characters [\n] for having segments,
# and then each segment we split by arrow string [ -> ] and commas [,],
# additionally mapping each numerical value to a pair of integers).
# Next we process the list of sequences to find the individual coordinates
# where the rocks are located, so from the each given sequence we take each
# pair as the start (x1, y1) and the end (x2, y2) of a line of rocks, then
# we save in a set all the points between start and end.
# Then we start spawning the grains of sand in an infinite loop.
# For each grain, from its initial position, we attempt to move down as long
# as there is a space under it; if no space directly under, we check whether
# there is a space to the left-under position or to the right-under position
# â€“ if any of this latter is true, we move the grain there; otherwise we cannot
# move any further and we put leave the grain at current position, so it will
# act like another obstacle from now on. This repeats to a point where every
# next grain will start falling to the abyss, after being shifted be left/right
# beyond all known lines of rocks. If we detect such situation (the calculated
# grain position is behind the last rock [position greater than the max `y`
# from the initial list of sequences) we stop spawning the sand (break a loop).
# Finally we return the number of added obstacles that filled the area.
