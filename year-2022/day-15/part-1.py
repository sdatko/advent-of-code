# --- Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone ---
#
# You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large
# network of subterranean tunnels. You don't have time to search them all,
# but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable sensors that
# you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.
#
# The sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device
# indicates that you're close enough to the source of the distress signal
# to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack,
# hit the big button on top, and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.
#
# Once a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches
# itself to a hard surface and begins monitoring for the nearest signal source
# beacon. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each sensor
# knows its own position and can determine the position of a beacon precisely;
# however, sensors can only lock on to the one beacon closest to the sensor
# as measured by the Manhattan distance. (There is never a tie where two
# beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)
#
# It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions
# and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:
#
#   Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
#   Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
#   Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
#   Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
#   Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
#   Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
#   Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
#   Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
#   Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
#   Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17
#   Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22
#   Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
#   Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
#   Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
#
# So, consider the sensor at 2,18; the closest beacon to it is at -2,15.
# For the sensor at 9,16, the closest beacon to it is at 10,16.
#
# Drawing sensors as S and beacons as B, the above arrangement of sensors
# and beacons looks like this:
#
#                  1    1    2    2
#        0    5    0    5    0    5
#    0 ....S.......................

#
# This isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the area,
# though. Because each sensor only identifies its closest beacon, if a sensor
# detects a beacon, you know there are no other beacons that close or closer
# to that sensor. There could still be beacons that just happen to not be
# the closest beacon to any sensor. Consider the sensor at 8,7:
#
#                  1    1    2    2
#        0    5    0    5    0    5

#
# This sensor's closest beacon is at 2,10, and so you know there are no beacons
# that close or closer (in any positions marked #).
#
# None of the detected beacons seem to be producing the distress signal,
# so you'll need to work out where the distress beacon is by working out
# where it isn't. For now, keep things simple by counting the positions
# where a beacon cannot possibly be along just a single row.
#
# So, suppose you have an arrangement of beacons and sensors like
# in the example above and, just in the row where y=10, you'd like
# to count the number of positions a beacon cannot possibly exist.
# The coverage from all sensors near that row looks like this:
#
#                  1    1    2    2
#        0    5    0    5    0    5
#  9 ...#########################...
# 10 ..####B######################..
# 11 .###S#############.###########.
#
# In this example, in the row where y=10, there are 26 positions
# where a beacon cannot be present.
#
# Consult the report from the sensors you just deployed.
# In the row where y=2000000, how many positions cannot contain a beacon?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# We start by reading the input file into a list of readings from sensors
# by removing all unnecessary characters and parsing the remaining data
# into tuples of 4 integers, such as `x1 y1 x2 y2` â€“ the position of sensor
# (x1, y1) and the closest beacon (x2, y2).
# For each sensor, we calculate how far it is from a given target Y position
# and if that position is in the sensor's range (the L1 distance from sensor
# to the closes beacon), we calculate what are the X positions available
# on the given target Y position. For example, assuming the sensor range
# is 7 units (the distance between S and B) and sensor S is 3 units below
# the target Y line, there are 4 steps available for the movement along X axis,
# so the range for X positions are [Sx - 4; Sx + 4] in this case.
# See the illustration below for understanding:
#
#   ---xxxx+xxxx------ target Y
#          |
#          |   7 units
#          S-------B
#
# After finding all such ranges, we just sum the number of unique positions
# within those ranges. In current implementation I am doing this naively,
# producing a set() of numbers, which is not very effective, but still solves
# the problem for given input under 1 second, which is good enough for me now.
# As an answer we just return the number of elements in set.
