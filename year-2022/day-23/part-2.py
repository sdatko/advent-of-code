# --- Day 23: Unstable Diffusion / Part Two ---
#
# It seems you're on the right track. Finish simulating the process and figure
# out where the Elves need to go. How many rounds did you save them?
#
# In the example above, the first round where no Elf moved was round 20:
#
#   .......#......
#   ....#......#..
#   ..#.....#.....
#   ......#.......
#   ...#....#.#..#
#   #.............
#   ....#.....#...
#   ..#.....#.....
#   ....#.#....#..
#   .........#....
#   ....#......#..
#   .......#......
#
# Figure out where the Elves need to go.
# What is the number of the first round where no Elf moves?
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# The difference in this part is that instead of a running for a fixed number
# of rounds, we launch the simulation as long as there are any moves performed.
# The final answer is a number of final round that was run.
