# --- Day 25: Full of Hot Air / Part Two ---
#
# The hot air balloons quickly carry you to the North Pole. As soon as you
# land, most of the expedition is escorted directly to a small building
# attached to the reindeer stables.
#
# The head smoothie chef has just finished warming up the industrial-grade
# smoothie blender as you arrive. It will take 50 stars to fill the blender.
# The expedition Elves turn their attention to you, and you begin emptying
# the fruit from your pack onto the table.
#
# As you do, a very young Elf - one you recognize from the expedition team
# - approaches the table and holds up a single star fruit he found.
# The head smoothie chef places it in the blender.
#
# Only 49 stars to go.
#
#
# --- Solution ---
#
# Having 49 stars collected, this one was just about pressing
# the [Start The Blender] button.
